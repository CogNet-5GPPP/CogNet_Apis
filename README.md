### Goals
[Top][]

CogNets aims at building an intelligent system of insight and action for 5G network management.

The interfaces of the CogNet infrastructure related to specific technologies involved. Driven by an implementation and integration perspective, the goal is to define a set of consolidated formats and interfaces that covers, in general, all the intrinsic developments/implementations carried out by the partners around the demonstrators. This means that aspects out of the picture, not tied to concrete developments or implementations from partners, are dropped.

The integration across teams from different entities and backgrounds requires interfaces that establish the implementation principles that enable mashing up different datasets and systems involved in the different demonstrators. To this end, this document makes uniform the information exchanged and interfaces of the main subsystems.

### Structure
[Top][]

The generic structure of this repository is:
  * API: definition of the interface and the format of the exchanged data.
  * helloworld: minimal sample code.
